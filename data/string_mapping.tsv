Cytoplasmic calcium released from the ER triggers apoptosis by the activation of CaM kinase II, eventually leading to the activation of downstream apoptosis pathways (By similarity); Inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptors
993	ENSG00000174358	9606.ENSP00000305302	SLC6A19	Sodium-dependent neutral amino acid transporter B(0)AT1; Transporter that mediates resorption of neutral amino acids across the apical membrane of renal and intestinal epithelial cells. This uptake is sodium-dependent and chloride- independent; Belongs to the sodium:neurotransmitter symporter (SNF) (TC 2.A.22) family. SLC6A19 subfamily
994	ENSG00000166482	9606.ENSP00000378957	MFAP4	Microfibril-associated glycoprotein 4; Could be involved in calcium-dependent cell adhesion or intercellular interactions. May contribute to the elastic fiber assembly and/or maintenance; Fibrinogen C domain containing
995	ENSG00000111796	9606.ENSP00000229402	KLRB1	Killer cell lectin-like receptor subfamily B member 1; Plays an inhibitory role on natural killer (NK) cells cytotoxicity. Activation results in specific acid sphingomyelinase/SMPD1 stimulation with subsequent marked elevation of intracellular ceramide. Activation also leads to AKT1/PKB and RPS6KA1/RSK1 kinases stimulation as well as markedly enhanced T-cell proliferation induced by anti-CD3. Acts as a lectin that binds to the terminal carbohydrate Gal-alpha(1,3)Gal epitope as well as to the N-acetyllactosamine epitope. Binds also to CLEC2D/LLT1 as a ligand and inhibits NK cell-mediate [...] 
996	ENSG00000169715	9606.ENSP00000307706	MT1E	Metallothionein-1E; Metallothioneins have a high content of cysteine residues that bind various heavy metals; these proteins are transcriptionally regulated by both heavy metals and glucocorticoids; Belongs to the metallothionein superfamily. Type 1 family
997	ENSG00000136960	9606.ENSP00000259486	ENPP2	Ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase family member 2; Hydrolyzes lysophospholipids to produce lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) in extracellular fluids. Major substrate is lysophosphatidylcholine. Also can act on sphingosylphosphphorylcholine producing sphingosine-1-phosphate, a modulator of cell motility. Can hydrolyze, in vitro, bis-pNPP, to some extent pNP-TMP, and barely ATP. Involved in several motility- related processes such as angiogenesis and neurite outgrowth. Acts as an angiogenic factor by stimulating migration of smooth muscle cells and microtubule formation. Stimula [...] 
998	ENSG00000048462	9606.ENSP00000053243	TNFRSF17	Tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 17; Receptor for TNFSF13B/BLyS/BAFF and TNFSF13/APRIL. Promotes B-cell survival and plays a role in the regulation of humoral immunity. Activates NF-kappa-B and JNK; CD molecules
999	ENSG00000178462	9606.ENSP00000369784	TUBAL3	Tubulin alpha chain-like 3; Tubulin is the major constituent of microtubules. It binds two moles of GTP, one at an exchangeable site on the beta chain and one at a non-exchangeable site on the alpha chain (By similarity); Belongs to the tubulin family
1000	ENSG00000115263	9606.ENSP00000387662	GCG	Glucagon; Glicentin may modulate gastric acid secretion and the gastro-pyloro-duodenal activity. May play an important role in intestinal mucosal growth in the early period of life; Belongs to the glucagon family
